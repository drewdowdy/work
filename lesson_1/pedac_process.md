# The PEDAC Process

## P: [Understanding the] Problem

- Establish rules & define bondaries
  - Assess available info
  - what is the **input** / **output**
  - Restate  **explicit requirements**
  - Identify **implicit requirements**
- Spend enough time, _don't rush_
- Ask questions and clarify definitions

## E: Examples and Test Cases

- What examples are provided?
- What edge cases need to be considered?

## D: Data Structures

- What type of data is going to be used in your solution?
  - (the data structure heavily influences your algorithm so these steps usually come together)

## A: Algorithm

- This is your step-by-step process of what the program should do
  - Like a 'recipie'
  - Use pseudocode (does NOT need to be formal)
- Some steps might need clarification or their own algorithms
- Revisit and revise algorithm often to problem solve

## C: [Implementing a solution in] Code

- Translate algorithm into code
- Think about limitations of methods and data structures
